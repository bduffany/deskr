# deskr

Have you ever wished that...

- You could start all of your apps that are essential to your DAILY workflow
- Drag them to the exact location on your monitors that you ALWAYS drag them to every
  FREAKING time you turn on your computer...

## ALL IN ONE CLICK???

_Well then, have I got an app for you!_

(DISCLAIMER: This can only be considered an "app" if you are **tech-savvy** enough
to run arbitrary code downloaded from the Internet on your _c o m p u t e r_)

## DESKR

Pronounced "desker" (I am very bad at names), this app allows you to create
desktop shortcuts for spawning a whole bunch of windows all at once, and
move them to your preferred locations on your desktop(s).

THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS. DESKTOP SHORTCUTS. YOU CAN DO THIS ALL IN ONE CLICK.

You click a freaking DESKTOP ICON and your entire workflow is instantly brought to life.

Because I care DEEPLY about saving you those `20.8497` seconds that it takes you to
open up Spotify, Chrome, VS Code, and all that other shit, every freaking time you
turn on your computer.

(By the way, the only reason you ever turn off your computer is because you are an
_environmentalist_ who cares deeply about _saving power_ and therefore saving the
**environment**)

### IF YOU DON'T HAVE AT LEAST 2 MONITORS ARE YOU EVEN A REAL DEVELOPER?

_NOTE: This app ONLY works on XFCE. But if you're not on Ubuntu 20.04 with XFCE,
what are you even **DOING** with your life?_

(In case you haven't noticed, I am trying way too hard to sell you on this app.
Please SMASH that ‚≠ê button on GitHub if you like this README and remember to
follow if you'd like to submit bug reports and have them not responded to for
several weeks because I am very busy with my day job(s).)

## HOW THE F\*\*\* DO I USE THIS STUPID PIECE OF SOFTWARE???

_"Dangit Napolean, write yourself a dang CONFIG file!"_

- Clone this repo to your computer using the `git clone` command
  - Git is a highly sophisticated piece of technology that allows you to _control_ your _source code_
- Check out `example.deskr.yaml`
- Make your own dang config file that is similar to the example
- The example YAML file is so _WELL DOCUMENTED_ that I can afford to be lazy enough
  to NOT have to add more documentation in this STUPID README FILE THAT YOU HAVE SPENT
  WAY TOO LONG READING
- Run `./deskr create-shortcut path/to/your/config/file`

## A BUNCH OF EMOJIS (AS PROOF THAT THIS SOFTWARE WAS WRITTEN IN 2020)

üî• üëÄ üíØ

And let's not forget about our favorite emoji: üöÄ

(The rocket emoji indicates that we are headed towards the stars.
#TechnologicalAdvancement)
